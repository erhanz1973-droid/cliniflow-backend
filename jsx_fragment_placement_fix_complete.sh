echo "🔧 JSX Fragment Placement Fix Complete!"
echo "======================================"

echo ""
echo "✅ JSX FRAGMENT PLACEMENT FIX:"
echo ""
echo "🎯 1️⃣ Problem Identified:"
echo "   📄 Error: Adjacent JSX elements must be wrapped in an enclosing tag"
echo "   📄 Location: diagnosis.tsx line 422 (bundling failed)"
echo "   📄 Issue: JSX fragment was placed incorrectly in the component structure"
echo "   📄 Impact: Bundling failed, app couldn't load"
echo "   📄 Root cause: Fragment was placed after View closing but before ScrollView closing"
echo "   📄 Previous fix attempt: Fragment wrapper was placed in wrong position"
echo ""
echo "🎯 2️⃣ Root Cause Analysis:"
echo "   📄 JSX fragment <>...</> was placed incorrectly in the component hierarchy"
echo "   📄 Fragment was inserted after View closing tags but before ScrollView closing"
echo "   📄 This created invalid JSX structure: View -> [content] -> </View> -> <> -> </ScrollView>"
echo "   📄 JSX parser couldn't handle the malformed fragment placement"
echo "   📄 Component structure was broken at the fragment insertion point"
echo "   📄 Solution needed: Remove incorrect fragment placement entirely"
echo ""
echo "🎯 3️⃣ Solution Implemented:"
echo "   📄 Removed incorrectly placed JSX fragment from component structure"
echo "   📄 Restored proper JSX structure without fragment wrapper"
echo "   📄 Maintained ScrollView and Modal as direct children of main View"
echo "   📄 Ensured proper JSX element hierarchy and nesting"
echo "   ✅ Fragment placement: Removed incorrect <> and </> tags"
echo "   ✅ ScrollView: Properly closed within main View structure"
echo "   ✅ Modal: Properly positioned as sibling to ScrollView within main View"
echo "   ✅ Main View: Contains ScrollView and Modal as direct children"
echo "   ✅ JSX structure: Valid parent-child relationship without fragment"
echo "   ✅ Parser compliance: JSX structure resolves adjacent elements issue naturally"
echo ""
echo "✅ TECHNICAL FIX DETAILS:"
echo ""
echo "🧠 JSX Structure Before (Incorrect):"
echo "   📄 <View style={{ flex: 1 }}> (main container)"
echo "   📄 <ScrollView> (scrollable area)"
