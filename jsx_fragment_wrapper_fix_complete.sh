echo "🔧 JSX Fragment Wrapper Fix Complete!"
echo "=================================="

echo ""
echo "✅ JSX FRAGMENT WRAPPER FIX:"
echo ""
echo "🎯 1️⃣ Problem Identified:"
echo "   📄 Error: Adjacent JSX elements must be wrapped in an enclosing tag"
echo "   📄 Location: diagnosis.tsx line 422 (iOS bundling)"
echo "   📄 Issue: ScrollView and Modal were adjacent JSX elements"
echo "   📄 Impact: iOS bundling failed, app couldn't load"
echo "   📄 Root cause: JSX parser couldn't handle sibling elements without wrapper"
echo "   📄 Previous fix attempt: Spacing fix didn't resolve the issue"
echo ""
echo "🎯 2️⃣ Root Cause Analysis:"
echo "   📄 ScrollView and Modal were both inside main View but adjacent"
echo "   📄 JSX requires sibling elements to be wrapped in a parent or fragment"
echo "   📄 Previous spacing fix was insufficient for JSX parser"
echo "   📄 JSX structure: View -> [ScrollView, Modal] (invalid sibling structure)"
echo "   📄 Parser error: Adjacent JSX elements without proper wrapper"
echo "   📄 Solution needed: JSX fragment <>...</> to wrap sibling elements"
echo ""
echo "🎯 3️⃣ Solution Implemented:"
echo "   📄 Wrapped ScrollView and Modal in JSX fragment <>...</>"
echo "   📄 Maintained proper JSX element separation with fragment wrapper"
echo "   📄 Ensured Modal placement outside ScrollView but inside main View"
echo "   📄 Fixed JSX parsing issues with fragment wrapper"
echo "   ✅ JSX fragment: <> opening tag before ScrollView"
echo "   ✅ ScrollView: Properly closed before Modal starts"
echo "   ✅ Modal: Properly positioned as sibling to ScrollView"
echo "   ✅ JSX fragment: </> closing tag after Modal"
echo "   ✅ Main View: Contains fragment as single child element"
echo "   ✅ JSX structure: Valid fragment-wrapped sibling elements"
echo "   ✅ Parser compliance: JSX fragment resolves adjacent elements issue"
echo ""
